    <h1>Hello there/h1>
    <p>Thank you for visiting jacob lee singer dot com.</p>
    <p>The old version of this website was boring and horribly out of date, so I took it down, and the new one isn't quite ready yet.</p>
    <p>It'll have a blog, links to places, and other fun stuff. It'll be much better than the old one, I promise.</p>
    <p>If you came here to hire me, check my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jacobleesinger">LinkedIn</a> and/or <a href="https://github.com/jacobleesinger">GitHub</a>, or reach out to <a href="mailto:jacobleesinger@gmail.com">jacobleesinger@gmail.com</a> and I'll be in touch.</p>
